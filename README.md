# Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
## Overview
 The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning based project that aims to assit farmers in making 
 informed decision about crops to cultivate based on various environmental factors such as soil type, nutrient content of the soil,
 humidity, ph, tempreature. The project uses a dataset of historical crop data and leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized
 crop recommendations.
## Getting Started
 To get started with this project, follow these steps
 1. Clone this repository
 2. install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
 3. run the project 
## Model Selection 
 Random Forest algorithm is used here as it is good for classification and regression tasks. it also suits the needs of
 crop recommendation.
