# Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
## Overview
 The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning based project that aims to assit farmers in making 
 informed decision about crops to cultivate based on various environmental factors such as soil type, nutrient content of the soil,
 humidity, ph, tempreature. The project uses a dataset of historical crop data and leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized
 crop recommendations.
## Model Selection 
 Random Forest algorithm is used here as it is good for classification and regression tasks. it also suits the needs of
 crop recommendation.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps

 

# React and Django Installation Guide

This guide will show you how to install React and Django on your system, as well as the required libraries for Django That Is Necessary For This Project To Work.

## React Installation

To install React, you will need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
### step 1 

Clone The Repository

### Step 2

Once you have cloned The Repository Then you can Initialize The Project using the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm Install 
```

This will Install all the necessary files and dependencies for a Frontend.

### Step 3

To run the app, you can use the following command:


```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server and open the app in your browser.

## Remember 
React Server Must Start On Port 3000, if The Port Is Not Started At Port 3000 Then Use This Command To Stop The Server That Uses The Port 3000 and Then Start Again 
### To Stop The Port 

```bash
npm kill-Port 3000
npm start
```


# Backend

## Django Installation

### Step 1 

To install Django, you will need to have **Python** installed on your system.

Once you have Python installed, you can install Django using the following command:

### Step 2

```bash
pip install Django
```
This will install the latest version of Django on your system.

### Step 3

## Django Libraries Installation

To install the required libraries for Django, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install djangorestframework django-cors-headers numpy joblib pandas scikit-learn
```

This will install the following libraries on your system:

- **djangorestframework**: A framework for building RESTful APIs with Django.
- **django-cors-headers**: A middleware that allows cross-origin requests to your Django app.
- **numpy**: A library for scientific computing with Python.
- **joblib**: A library for parallel and distributed computing with Python.
- **pandas**: A library for data analysis and manipulation with Python.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning and data mining with Python.

You can learn more about these libraries from their respective websites or documentation.

### Step 4 


To Run Or Start The Django Server You Have To Navigate To The Backend Folder Where The Manage.py File Exist And Run CMD or Terminal There And Type This Command 


```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver 
```



# Remember 

The Project Need Both Django And React Server To Work, so Before Checking The Project Make Sure That All The Necessary File And Dependency Installed And You Have Started The Django And React Server
