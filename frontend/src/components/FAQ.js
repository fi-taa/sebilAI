      question: "What is a Crop?",
      answer: (
        <>
          A crop is a cultivated plant that is grown on a large scale for
          agricultural or commercial purposes. Crops are essential for food,
          fibers, medicinal plants, and more. Sebil AI focuses on recommending
          suitable crops based on various factors to enhance agricultural
          practices.

      question: "What Does This System Work?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Sebil AI is a revolutionary tool that leverages artificial
          intelligence to provide personalized crop recommendations. By
          analyzing factors like humidity, pH, temperature, and rainfall, the
          system assists farmers in making informed decisions about which crops
          to cultivate. This leads to improved yields, efficient resource
          utilization, and sustainable practices.

    },
    {
      question: "How Does It Predict Crop Recommendations?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Sebil AI employs machine learning algorithms to analyze data collected
          from various sources, such as climate stations and soil testing. These
          algorithms learn patterns from historical data and correlate them with
          crop growth conditions. When a user inputs specific parameters, Sebil
          AI matches them against the learned patterns to provide accurate crop
          recommendations tailored to the user's location and conditions.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What is Humidity?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Humidity refers to the amount of moisture present in the air. In
          agriculture, humidity levels influence plant growth, transpiration,
          and disease susceptibility. Sebil AI considers humidity data to
          recommend crops that thrive in varying humidity conditions.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What is pH?",
      answer: (
        <>
          pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. Different crops
          have specific pH preferences. Sebil AI utilizes pH information to
          suggest crops that are well-suited to the soilâ€™s pH level, promoting
          optimal growth.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What is Temperature?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Temperature plays a crucial role in determining crop growth and
          development. Each crop has a range of temperature tolerance. Sebil AI
          analyzes temperature data to suggest crops that flourish in specific
          temperature conditions.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What is Rainfall?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Rainfall quantifies the amount of precipitation received in an area.
          It directly impacts water availability for crops. Sebil AI factors in
          rainfall data to recommend crops adapted to different levels of
          precipitation.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How Accurate are the Recommendations?",
      answer: (
        <>

          learning techniques. The recommendations are based on extensive data
          analysis, resulting in reliable guidance for crop selection.
